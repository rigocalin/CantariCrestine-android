<h3>Why Worship Songs?</h3>

<p>
Why develop another app when there are tons of similar apps?

And finally, the songs database evolves rapidly. New songs are added often, so you will never miss your favourite song.

<h4>Q. I couldn't find a song that I am looking for. What should I do?</h4>

<h4>
Q. I still couldn't find the song. I bet it's not there in your database. What now?
</h4>
<p>
You can create a new issue at our <a href="https://github.com/crunchersaspire/worshipsongs-db">Github project</a>. Worship Songs is an open source project. Anyone interested can contribute song lyrics. If you are interested, please let us know.
</p>

<h4>
Q. I want to request a new feature. How do I go about that?
</h4>
<p>
The songs database and the app are maintained in separate Github projects. This is because the songs database is shared by both the Android and iOS version of Worship Songs. Worship Songs for Android lives at https://github.com/crunchersaspire/worshipsongs-android. You can request for a new feature by creating an issue there.
</p>

<h4>
Q. How do I report bugs?

<p>
Please create an issue and apply the label "Bug" in our Github project. Kindly refer the previous question for project details. Please do not report bugs through comments.

</p>

<h4>
Q. Is there a way I can use these songs in my Church?
</h4>
<p>
Absolutely. In fact, the songs database that is shipped with this app is used by <a href="http://betania-tm.ro"> Bethany Baptist Church in Timisoara, Romania</a>. 
If you want to do that in your Church, you would need to install a software named OpenLP and replace it's default songs database with the one that ships with this app.
